Thank you for checking out VBMock. As you know, this is a VB6 mock object builder. 
It has many of the same features as EasyMock and NMock.


Installing VBMock by hand

1.	Copy VBMock.dll to your System folder (or any folder you choose).
2.	Register VBMock.dll using regsvr32.exe.
3.	Copy MockObject.cls in the Template\Classes folder to the corrisponding folder
	in VB98\Template\Classes folder.

It is suggested to download the example to see how it can be used.
